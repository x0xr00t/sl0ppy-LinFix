# sl0ppy-Kalifix
A small fixer for common linux|kali update|upgrade issues.This tool fixes most of the common issues on kali|deb.. It has a downgrade option for if needed. 

# fixes issues 
* apt issues
* dpkg issues
* checksum issues 
* broken install issues
* missing install files issues 

# extra functionality
* downgrade 

# note: 
this not fixes all issues, just most common issues for updating/upgrading issues.!!

# For depracated issues 
* I advice to run cheksum fix, to sort the issues...  

# for other linux dist.
* Edit the lin-fix.sh with the right stuff for ur dist.
* Edit the sources.list from kali to ur most recent distro

For the rest it should work as long u change that..!
